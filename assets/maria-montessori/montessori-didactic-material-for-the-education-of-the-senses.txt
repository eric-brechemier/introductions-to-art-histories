THE METHOD

The technique of my method as it follows the
guidance of the natural physiological and psy-
chical development of the child, may be divided
into three parts :

Motor education.
Sensory education.
Language.

The care and management of the environment
itself afford the principal means of motor educa-
tion, while sensory education and the education
of language are provided for by my didactic ma-
terial.

The didactic material for the education of the
senses consists of:
  (a) Three sets of solid insets.
  (b) Three sets of solids in graduated sizes,
        comprising :
        (1) Pink cubes.
        (2) Brown prisms.
        (3) Rods: (a) colored green; (b) colored
              alternately red and blue.
  (c) Various geometric solids (prism, pyramid,
        sphere, cylinder, cone, etc.).
  (d) Rectangular tablets with rough and smooth
        surfaces.
  (e) A collection of various stuffs.
  (f) Small wooden tablets of different weights.
  (g) Two boxes, each containing sixty-four
        colored tablets.
  (h) A chest of drawers containing plane insets.
  (i) Three series of cards on which are pasted
        geometrical forms in paper. 
  (k) A collection of cylindrical closed boxes
        (sounds).
  (l) A double series of musical bells, wooden
      boards on which are painted the lines
      used in music, small wooden discs for the
      notes.
